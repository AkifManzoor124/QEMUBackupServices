# QEMUBackupServices

With the hopes of being granted an interview with the cloud infrastucture team at Akamai, I hopes to build an impressive project which I can speak on.

I learned during the first interview that the team is currently working on creating backup and imaging services for their VMs being run on Qemu.

I'm thinking it may be a good idea to build a project, where I can spin up 3-5 VMs, DDoSing them into oblivion, and running the VM again with the previous backup/image

The aim is to gain an extensive knowledge backing up a VM, and to get it working again at the same capacity, and state that it was at previous to the shutdown

I want to see if there are tools out there that are able to take images, or store the state of a VM at any given point, and be able to spin it up once again

Can I create alerts on Grafana that will tell me that my VM is about to shutdown, and that a script is going to run to backup the state?

I would have to create the script for running the VM services back up again on my MacOS

How would I be able to monitor the status of the VM exactly? Should Grafana be the gateway from which I run my script to backup the VM?

How can I integrate more Perl into this project?
How can I integrate Go into this project, since I've recently learned they're currently using it


Run VMs
See if you can first create alerts using Grafana

Would those alerts be able to run any sort of scripts on my MacOS? Would it be an endpoint that I'd be calling that's on my local computer?
I would have to create a tunnel to expose my API to the internet
I would like to create some authentication for it

It's possible that I could have a monitoring script running on my computer


Don't forget to add pictures and videos about your learnings for this project. You can link your project on LinkedIn


Where do I start??!!!
The exictment is getting to me!

Create a vision. Create a plan.
What do you exactly hope to create that could potentially wow them?
I guess I'd really have to learn about the landscape, and see where I can add improvements.
I'm already excited enough to work on it
